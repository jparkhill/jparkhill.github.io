# The unreasonable usefulness of Stochastic DE's 

Certain regions of science are unfortunately mired in formalism, despite the fact that they are invaluable. Stochastic calculus is without a doubt, of these fields. A typical text on stochastics calculus will cover a series of formal theorems proving the existence of these integrals, but leave the reader without a clear picture of just how insanely practical these equations can be. If you're modeling any type of noisy timeseries, it would be a huge mistake to not spend at least some time considering a stochastic DE as your zeroth order model. This post will cover the elementary math you need to fit a stochastic equation onto observed data by MLE, and how useful these equation are for extrapolation, normalization, featurization etc. 

# Brownian example
Suppose you have observed the coordinates of a particle drifting to the right, but also subject to random forces. You have a data series $$ \{t, X_t\} $$
