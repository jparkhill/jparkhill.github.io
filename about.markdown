This page hosts whatever random ephemera is suitable from public consumption from my ongoing adventures, which are sadly mostly private now (tears).

Who am I? I'm the [John Parkhill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mkEouY4AAAAJ&hl=en) born in 1983 in IL. B.S. U of Chicago 2005, Ph.D. [UC Berkeley 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Head-Gordon), postdoc with [Alan Aspuru-Guzik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ag_6KEgAAAAJ&hl=en). Once professor at [Notre Dame](https://sites.nd.edu/parkhillgroup/?utm_campaign=redirect&utm_medium=web&utm_source=blogs.nd.edu). Presently found biking around Austin Texas, haunting [Frost Bank Tower](https://www.artemiscm.com/team) or on flights in or out of Austin. Not to be confused with my father John Parkhill, the John Parkhill who works in real-estate in the U.K. (who should update email addresses with his bank, Halifax), or the long-dead slave-owning [John Parkhill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscawilla_Plantation) (hopefully no relation).
